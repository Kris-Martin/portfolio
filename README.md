# Portfolio

This is a draft portfolio. It uses HTML5, SCSS/CSS3 and JavaScript. It is a work in progress.

As I made up the design as I coded, I plan to rewrite it from scratch - so that it behaves more consistently and the code is more modular and concise.

## Things to do include:

-   fix overflow bug on about page - full scrollbar does not show without padding
-   landing page - picture and/or animation
-   carousel for projects - bootstrap / replace radio buttons
-   icons for tech used in projects on project slides
-   clipboard email instead of default email - use javascript function
